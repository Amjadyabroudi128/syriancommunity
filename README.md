I have Learnt a lot of things while making this app and i feel like it was very beneficial for me 
* Image picking from gallery/camera
* adding image with text and make image nullable so text alone can be submitted
* Added date to post so people know when it was released
* Google Cloud maps API
* FCM (Firebase cloud messaging for notifications )
* Bloc ( used for Authentication )
* only allow one user (admin ) to sign in
* Hide/Show buttons depending on user
* selectable text in case someone wants to copy the phone number or the email address of the Community
* Localization
* theming
* clean structure
* added email and phone Launcher
